# Description
The [CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2017.html) is an annual phone survey of health conditions and health-related behaviors of people throughout the US. The dataset for 2017 has 450,016 individuals and 358 columns. I am generally interested in exploring this dataset and seeing how different behaviors and demographics correlate with health.

# Preliminary Results

Here are two preliminary plots from the dataset. In the first plot, I examine rates of asthma, skin cancer, and arthritis vs. income for people 18 - 35 years old. Interestingly, people from higher income households have lower rates of asthma and arthritis and higher rates of skin cancer. The higher rates of skin cancer among high income households may be due to the racial and ethnic income inequality in the US. In the second plot I look at heart disease/attack vs. body weight and alcohol consumption. While there is an obvious correlation between heart disease/attack and body weight, this is not the case for alcohol consumption.
