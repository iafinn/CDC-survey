## Description

The data files are too large for github, but available from the [BRFSS website](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html). I used the data from 2017 for the analysis in python and data from 2013 for the analysis in R as part of Coursera/Duke University's "Statistics with R Specialization."
